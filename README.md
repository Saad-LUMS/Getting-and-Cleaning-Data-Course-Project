# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
This repo houses my analysis files for the Data Science Specialization Course# 4.
The data set in use can be found at:

Description of the Files:
The variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data is outlined in CodeBook.md

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. 

The tidy data set output by the script is called tidy_data.txt.
